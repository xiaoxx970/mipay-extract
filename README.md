# Mi Pay Extractor
Extract Mi Pay from MIUI China Rom

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/xiaoxx970/mipay-extract.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/xiaoxx970/mipay-extract)

**Use at your own risk!**

## Usage
Put MIUI 9 China Rom (OTA zip package) in the directory and double-click `extract.bat` (Windows) or run `./extract.sh` (macOS and Linux) to generate the flashable zip.

Additionally, if you want to recover Chinese functions, e.g. bus card shortcut or quick payments for WeChat/Alipay in "App Vault" (i.e. the leftmost shortcut page on home screen), you can add an option `--appvault`: `extract.bat --appvault` (Windows) or `./extract.sh --appvault` (macOS and Linux). An extra flashable zip file with prefix `eufix-appvault` will be generated.

Support Windows, Linux and macOS (10.10 or above). Windows version has all dependencies included. For macOS, you need Java 8 runtime. For Linux, you may need both Java 8 and Python 2.7. For example, you can install all dependencies using `apt-get`:

```bash
apt-get install -y openjdk-8-jre python2.7
```

**Note**: 
- It is recommended to run `extract.bat` on Windows. WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) is **not supported** due to issues of the emulated file system in WSL. You need a real Linux VM on Windows to run `./extract.sh`.
- To avoid line-ending issues, Windows users should **directly** [download the repo](https://github.com/linusyang92/mipay-extract/archive/master.zip) through the Github's "Clone or Download" button, instead of using a Windows version's Git command. If you clone the repo using a MinGW version's Git, the line endings may be incorrectly converted to CR/LF, which makes the generated packages invalid to use.

Automatic builds for selected devices are available in [releases](https://github.com/linusyang92/mipay-extract/releases).

## Recover Chinese Functions

For users in China, you can also download the **xiaomi.eu rom** and run `cleaner-fix.sh` for creating a flashable zip with prefix `eufix`. It contains patches to

* Show Lunar dates in Calendar app.
* Fix FC of cleaner app.
* Show payment monitor options in setting page of Security app.
* Use Chinese weather sources in Weather app.
* Allow alarm of legal workday repeat mode.

## (Optional) Encryption for xiaomi.eu ROMs

It is recommended to enable encryption if you plan to use Mi Pay. Official MIUI roms (China or International) has encryption enabled by default. But xiaomi.eu roms **remove encryption** by default (check in "Settings-Privacy-Encryption"). Some early versions of EU roms have bootloop bugs when enabling encryption in Settings (**Backup before trying!**).

If your device cannot be encrypted normally in Settings, you can completely **format `/data/` partition** and flash the additional zip file `eufix-force-fbe-oreo.zip` after flashing xiaomi.eu ROM.

**Warning**: 

* Do not try to flash `eufix-force-fbe-oreo.zip` when your device is **decrypted**. It will cause bootloop. Only flash it when your device has a freshly formatted `/data` partition, or already encrypted.
* Formatting `/data` will destroy **EVERYTHING**, including all your personal data and external storage (`/sdcard`). Remember to backup before formatting.
* Once your `/data` partition is encrypted, it will be kept encrypted. But when you flash a new EU rom, the force encryption will be removed. You need to flash this file every time you flash a new EU rom.
